‚óè Well written Python code can run faster than badly written C/C++ code. ‚óè Common reason for bad performance is using unnecessary system calls.

‚óè In this assignment you improve the performance of a badly written C++ program.

Start by cloning the GIT repository:

$ git clone https://gitlab.com/cpsc457/public/a1 $ cd a1

The repository contains:

palindrome.py Python 3 program that reads in text from standard input and reports the longest palindrome to standard output.

slow-pali.cpp Not a very good C++ version of palindrome.py. Feel free to re-use any part of this code in your solution.

Makefile Makes compilation a bit easier.

t1.txt ‚Ä¶ t5.txt Some test files.

dup.py Python3 script that can generate big data (see appendix).

For this assignment we will use the following definitions:

Standard input Please read http://www.linfo.org/standard_input.html .

White space Whatever isspace() reports as white-space. Read the man page for isspace() for more information.

Word Non-zero-length sequence of characters delimited by white space.

Palindrome Any word that remains the same after reversing it and ignoring the case. Examples of palindromes: ‚ÄúDid‚Äù, ‚Äú01-!-10‚Äù, ‚Äúx‚Äù

Longest palindrome If there are multiple palindromes, the longest one is reported. If multiple palindromes have the same maximum length, report the first one.

For this question you will compare the performance of the python program (palindrome.py) to the C++ program (slow-pali.cpp) by using the time Unix utility. To time how long it takes to execute the python program on different test files, for example t4.txt and t5.txt, execute the following commands:

$ time python3 palindrome.py &lt; t4.txt

Longest palindrome: redder real 0m0.300s user 0m0.296s sys 0m0.003s

$ time python3 palindrome.py &lt; t5.txt Longest palindrome: DetartrateD real 0m0.023s user 0m0.016s sys 0m0.007s

Before you can time the C++ program, you need to compile it first. Here is how to compile the C++ code by using the included Makefile:

$ make g++ -O2 -Wall slow-pali.cpp -o slow-pali

If you wish, you can also compile it by hand:

$ g++ -O2 -Wall slow-pali.cpp ‚Äìo slow-pali

Now you can time the resulting executable slow-pali:

$ time ./slow-pali &lt; t4.txt Longest palindrome: redder real 0m2.929s user 0m1.477s sys 0m1.450s

$ time ./slow-pali &lt; t5.txt Longest palindrome: DetartrateD real 0m0.003s user 0m0.000s sys 0m0.003s

Answer the following questions:

a) Time the python code and C++ code on t4.txt and t3.txt using the time utility. Copy/paste the outputs from the terminal output to your report.

b) How much time did the C++ and python programs spend in kernel vs user mode?

c) Why is the python program faster on some inputs when compared to C++ code? Why is the python program slower on other inputs?

It is embarrassing for a C++ run slower than Python. Your job is to improve the code in slow-pali.cpp by writing a new implementation called fast-pali.cpp. Your new implementation should be faster than slow-pali.cpp and at least as fast as palindrome.py for all possible inputs!

Requirements

‚óè Your program must read input from standard input.

‚óè You are only allowed to use the read() system call wrapper. You cannot use any other APIs, such as mmap(), fopen(), fread(), fgetc(), or C++‚Äôs streams. Hint: all you need to do is to adjust the code to use read() with a buffer size of 1MiB.

‚óè Do not store the entire input in memory. You need to write your code so that it can handle any input size, even if it is bigger than the available memory.

‚óè Your program must run on linuxlab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca. Use SSH to test your code before you submit it!

Valid input

Some test files are available to you, but it is expected that you create your own test files to help you validate your solutions. Your TAs will grade your code on inputs that are not published to you. Only valid inputs will be used to grade your code.

Marking

$ ./dup.py 2000000000 &lt; t4.txt | time ./fast-pali

Longest palindrome: redder

28.79user 0.25system 0:29.52elapsed 98%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 4076maxresident)k

0inputs+0outputs (0major+382minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Here is another test you can run:

$ seq 101010101 | time -p ./ fast-pali

Longest palindrome: 100000001 real 10.18 user 9.87 sys 0.09

Measure the performance of your fast-pali.cpp from Q2 and compare it to the timings you obtained for slow-pali.cpp and palindrome.py in Q1. Answer the following:

a) Is your fast-pali.cpp faster than slow-pali.cpp? Why do you think that is?

b) Is your program faster or slower than palindrome.py and why?

Justify your answers by using the strace utility with the ‚Äú-c‚Äù command line option. Include the output of strace in your report.

Submission

Submit two files for this assignment to D2L:

1. Answers to the written questions Q1 and Q3 combined into a single file called report.[pdf|docx|txt]. Do not use any other file formats.

2. Your solution to Q2 in a file called fast-pali.cpp.

Submit these files as two separate files, i.e. do not submit an archive, such as ZIP or TAR. If you submit an archive, you will receive a penalty.

General information about all assignments:

3. After you submit your work to D2L, verify your submission by re-downloading it.

http://www.ucalgary.ca/pubs/calendar/current/k-5.html.

9. Here are some examples of what you are not allowed to do for individual assignments: you are not allowed to copy code or written answers (in part, or in whole) from anyone else; you are not allowed to collaborate with anyone; you are not allowed to share your solutions with anyone else; you are not allowed to sell or purchase a solution. This list is not exclusive.

Appendix ‚Äì dup2.py utility (aka. testing your code on big files)

Many of you probably do not have enough quota to store 2Gib test files in your accounts. I created a python scripts called dup.py to make it possible to test your program on large inputs, without having to store big files.

dup2.py is a simple python program that accepts a single command line argument ‚ÄúN‚Äù, which indicates the number of bytes that the script will generate on standard output. dup.py reads in data from stdin, byte by byte, and outputs the data to stdout. It always outputs N bytes. If the data on stdin is bigger than N bytes, only first N bytes are copied. If the data on stdin is shorter than N, the script will repeat the input data, until N bytes are generated. Example:

$ echo ‚Äúhello.‚Äù | ./dup.py 10 hello. hel

Here is an example of how to feed 2GB of data to your program, generated by repeating t3.txt:

$ ./dup.py 2000000000 &lt; t3.txt | ./fast-pali

Here is how you can time your code on the same data:

$ ./dup.py 2000000000 &lt; t3.txt | time ./fast-pali

Here is how to run strace in combination with dup.py:

$ ./dup.py 2000000000 &lt; t3.txt | strace -c ./fast-pali
